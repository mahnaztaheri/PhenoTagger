We present an 11-year-old girl with clinical features consistent with BCNS including bridging of sella turcica, biparietal bossing, downward slanting palpebral fissures, mandible prognathism, pectus excavatum, thumb abnormalities, occult spina bifida at L5-S4, numerous basal cell nevi, and single basal cell carcinoma. Cytogenetic analysis using high-resolution banding techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed interstitial chromosome deletion 9q22.32-q33.2 involving the PTCH gene as a secondary breakage event to a chromosome translocation t(9;17)(q34.1;p11.2)mat. Further FISH studies showed the translocation breakpoint on 9q34.11 maps proximal to ABL, between the BAC clone RP11-88G17 and the LMX1B gene. The latter gene encodes a transcription factor, in which loss of function mutations are responsible for the nail-patella syndrome (NPS, #161200 OMIM). Interestingly, some features of our proband (e.g., bilateral patellar dysplasia and abnormal clavicular shape), as well as her healthy sister who carries the same translocation, are also found in patients with NPS.

We present an 11-year-old girl with clinical features consistent with BCNS including bridging of sella turcica, biparietal bossing, downward slanting palpebral fissures, mandible prognathism, pectus excavatum, thumb abnormalities, occult spina bifida at L5-S4, numerous basal cell nevi, and single basal cell carcinoma. Cytogenetic analysis using high-resolution banding techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed interstitial chromosome deletion 9q22.32-q33.2 involving the PTCH gene as a secondary breakage event to a chromosome translocation t(9;17)(q34.1;p11.2)mat. Further FISH studies showed the translocation breakpoint on 9q34.11 maps proximal to ABL, between the BAC clone RP11-88G17 and the LMX1B gene. The latter gene encodes a transcription factor, in which loss of function mutations are responsible for the nail-patella syndrome (NPS, #161200 OMIM).

BOR syndrome is an autosomal dominant trait encompassing branchial, otic and renal anomalies because of mutations in EYA1, SIX1 and SIX5. In this study, we have clinically and genetically diagnosed a proband that displayed STL1 and BOR syndromes. This patient and his younger brother exhibited hearing loss and cleft palate. Both siblings and their mother also showed myopia, congenital non-progressive vitreous anomaly and a flat face. Taken together, these clinical features are consistent with the diagnosis of a familial case of STL. Sequence analysis revealed in the three patients a novel COL2A1 mutation (c.1468_1475delinsT) that accounted for a STL1 phenotype.
